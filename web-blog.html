Introduction to Bootstrap

Get started with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with
Bootstrap CDN and a template starter page.

According to the official website, Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive,
mobile first projects on the web. Sounds great! Now how do I use it? It would be easy to send you over to their Getting
Started page and call it a day. Their setup guide is indeed a host of useful information — links to CDNs, explanations
on how to install with Bower, npm, and Composer, information on integration with Autoprefixer and LESS, a bunch of
templates, licenses, and translations — but you could read this blog here instead for a better and easier understanding.

CSS Quoted
Copy-paste the stylesheet link into your head before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
JS Quoted
Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require jQuery, Popper.js, and our
own JavaScript plugins. Place the following scripts near the end of your pages, right before the closing bodytag, to
enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper.js, and then our JavaScript plugins.We use jQuery’s slim build, but the
full version is also supported.
